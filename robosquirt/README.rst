Quick Start
-----------

Run this stuff::

    $> pip install -r requirements/base.txt
    $> python3 -m robosquirt.server

If your platform isn't identified as Linux, it's assumed you're not running the code on an actual Rasperry Pi, and ``pip install`` will install a Raspberry Pi emulator and use that instead.

Optionally, install development requirements::

    $> pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
